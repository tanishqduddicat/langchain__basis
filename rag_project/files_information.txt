---------------------------------------------------------rag1_part_1.py---------------------------------------------------

Responsible for loading a single pdf from books dir and storing them in the vector store after converting the chunks into 
embeddings.

------------------------------------------------------------rag2_part1.py-----------------------------------------

Responsible for loading the all the pdfs from books dir and storing them in the vector store after converting the chunks into 
embeddings.

we are also going to be adding the metadata: in this case the source of the doucment is also added to each induvidual chunk so that the
user can proof check if needed when the chunks are retrieved once the user prompt is passed as input.

-----------------------------------------------------rag1_part2.py and rag_2part2.py-----------------------------------------

Responsible for fetching the relevant documents from the already created vector store by asking a user query. we will be using the vector store as 
a retriever and would invoke it by passing in the user query as the input.

----------------------------------------------------------embeddings.py--------------------------------------------------------

Demonstrates different embedding models could be used when storing in vector store.
